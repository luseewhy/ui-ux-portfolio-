# UI-Alchemist_Roastery_Cafe
"Alchemist Roastery" is a cafe in Ajmer city, Rajasthan. It is one of the popular and widely loved cafe by citizens of all age groups due to its calm yet vibrant energy and the wide variety of dishes and drinks which it offers. Its speciality is coffee which they roast in-house. Also, if you are someone who loves to experiment with different shades of art on their plate then they have some amazing and my all time favourite dishes, like bubblegum mohito, popcorn caramel shake, Humus falafal and many more.

What got my heart hooked to this cafe is its aesthetics. every corner in this cafe has been given personal attention by adding various art frames, or indoor/outdoor plants. Wall paintings, and Book shevles/ game section are cherry on the top. This makes the cafe's environment welcoming and homely where the lovely staff members paly a vital role. I can for sure spend hours their with my loved ones.

# Why did I choose to redesign their website?
As I said, the aesthetics of the cafe caught my heart, but the website did not get me clipped onto it even for 2 minutes. So I planned to re-design their already existing website (link will be provided below).
I wanted to get the same energy, and aesthetics to their website as their cafe and so I am sharing my first rough UI design version below. It includes some variations like the "Add story" section. I have also tried to changed the look of this website by playing with different shades of brown.

# How I approached the problem?
Their existing website focused heavily on the roastery aspect but did not effectively capture the in-café experience, which is a major part of their brand identity.

I approached the problem by first identifying two key user groups: customers interested in purchasing roasted coffee, and customers seeking the café experience. I aimed to create a balanced design that catered to both audiences without losing focus on their core business.

To make the website more engaging and community-driven, I added new sections where customers could share reviews, rate their experiences, and even write short anecdotes about their time at the café. This not only helped in highlighting the atmosphere of the café but also created a more interactive and inviting platform for visitors.

I used Figma for the entire design process, from wireframing to high-fidelity prototyping, ensuring the designs were both user-friendly and visually aligned with the café’s brand personality.
